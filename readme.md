# PDF Project
This project was created for training the Python programming language in conjunction with the use of the MySQL database. Primarily consists of using a programs menu where the user can analyze PDF files, counting and classifying the words that are most used. A CSV file contains exception words (as well as articles) that will be disregarded in the procedures. A CRUD program for recording, reading, updating and removing records was developed to maintain a table (special word) that stores words that the user may consider important in future analyses. With new updates, the objective is to generate an index of the words that appear most in the specified PDFs and also of the special words.

## Considerations
Built and tested with Windows 11, Python 3.9.13('base':conda), MySQL v.8.0.31
